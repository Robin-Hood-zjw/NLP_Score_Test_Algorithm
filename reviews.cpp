// PARAMETERS:
//   input - An input stream from which keywords and weights are read. For this project, we
//           assume the input stream is a file input stream, where the file format is that
//           provided in the project specification.

//   weights - An "output parameter", passed by reference, into which the weights are stored.

//   input - An input stream from which the review is read. For this project, we assume the
//           input stream is a file input stream, with words separated by whitespace.and

// keywords vector, its weight is zero.
// HINT: Make a copy of the reviewWords vector using a separate variable. Then, call the
//       preprocessReview() function on the copy. Having a preprocessed copy of the words
//       will allow you to compare against the keywords.

//   keywords - A vector containing all keywords.
//   weights - A vector containing weights corresponding to each keyword.
